## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This project thought me how to use CSS flexbox properties to create a responsive layout. I also learnt how to use CSS transform function to responsively center any item.

### Continued development

I want to delve deep into using CSS grid and flexbox to create complex responsive layout just like this product card, but many of it for e-commerce application.
